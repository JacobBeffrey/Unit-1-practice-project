    <p>My name is Jacob, I am 22 years old and currently living in kalamazoo with my girlfriend mackenzie and best friend logan. I enjoy Video games, golf, bowling, watching movies 
     with my friends.</p>
  <h2 id="my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p>I first became interested in coding during high school. i had taking a web designe class and a computer sience class where we did some coding here and there. It always 
     interested me but i never pursued it anymore until now</p>
    <p2>At the beginning of 2022, two of my very close friends had gone through the bootcamp and ended up recomending it to me. They would tell me how hard it was and all the 
     struggles they faced while taking this bootcamp, but reasured me that if this is something i really wanted to follow, grand circus would be a great commitment. </p2>
